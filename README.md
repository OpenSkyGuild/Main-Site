<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> A <b>guild</b> is a group comprised of coninciding interests. Historically, it described associations of medieval merchants and craftsmen, while the modern usage is often for organizations of people with similar professions seeking civil and job security. Think trade unions and writers' guilds. In any case, guides have timelessly been a union of peoples for their protection and benefit. The OpenSky Guild is no different. <b>Anyone</b> wishing to develop more knowledge and insight into world and its inner workings is welcome.</p>
